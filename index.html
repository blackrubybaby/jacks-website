                    promote excellence in music education among high school students in Arizona. The award is typically

                AMEA Regional Festival Participant 2019-2021
                <p>
                    Participation in the Arizona Music Educators Association (AMEA) Regional Festival on tenor saxophone
                    is an opportunity for high school students in Arizona to showcase their musical talents and skills.
                    To participate in the festival, students typically need to audition by performing a prepared piece
                    of music and scales for a judge. The Regional Festival is a stepping stone to the All-State festival
                    where the highest-rated high school performers are chosen to perform. It is an excellent opportunity
                    for high school musicians in Arizona to gain recognition and to further develop their musical
                    talents and skills.
